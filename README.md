# Tocuhtyping-Demo

The code is a React component for a web application with typing exercises and game modes. 
It imports dependencies, sets up state variables for theme, sound mode, game mode, etc. 
It handles theme and sound type changes, toggles for focused, coffee, and trainer modes.
It manages focus on different input elements based on the active mode. It renders nested components like TypeBox, SentenceBox, FreeTypingBox, DefaultKeyboard, Logo, and FooterMenu. 
It applies themes using styled-components and includes global styles. The code aims to create an interactive typing application with various features and modes.

Currently I am still developing the code to add more features.

Install all the necessary node_modules.

Type "npm start" in the terminal of the VS Code.

It will host the web in localhost:3000.
