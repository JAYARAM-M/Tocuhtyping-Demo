# Tocuhtyping-Demo

The code is a React component for a web application with typing exercises and game modes. 
It imports dependencies, sets up state variables for theme, sound mode, game mode, etc. 
It handles theme and sound type changes, toggles for focused, coffee, and trainer modes.
It manages focus on different input elements based on the active mode. It renders nested components like TypeBox, SentenceBox, FreeTypingBox, DefaultKeyboard, Logo, and FooterMenu. 
It applies themes using styled-components and includes global styles. The code aims to create an interactive typing application with various features and modes.

The typing practice interface is designed to meet several specific criteria. Firstly, there is a typing box where the user can input their text by pressing keys on the keyboard. Secondly, the interface visually displays the keys that the user is supposed to type next, allowing them to anticipate and prepare for the upcoming keystrokes. Thirdly, the system tracks the number of keys pressed by the user within a 5-minute practice window, providing a quantitative measure of their typing speed. Lastly, the interface also measures the accuracy percentage by comparing the user's input with the expected text, giving them valuable feedback on their typing precision.

Currently I am still developing the code to add more features.
